1,"Data Mining is the process of discovering interesting knowledge from large amounts of data stored either in databases, data warehouses, or other information repositories. Topics to be covered includes: Data Preprocessing, Data Mining Primitives, Languages, and System Architectures, Mining Association Rules from Large Databases, Classification and Prediction, Cluster Analysis, Mining Complex Types of Data, Data Warehouse and OLAP technology for data mining (time permits), and Applications and Trends in Data Mining. With the unprecedented rate at which data is being collected today in almost all fields of human endeavor, there is an emerging economic and scientific need to extract useful information from it. Data mining is the process of automatic discovery of patterns, changes, associations and anomalies in massive databases, and is a highly interdisciplinary field representing the confluence of several disciplines, including database systems, data warehousing, machine learning, statistics, algorithms, data visualization, and high-performance computing. This course is an introduction to the commonly used data mining techniques. In the first part of the course, students will develop a basic understanding of the basic concepts in data mining such as frequent pattern mining, association rule mining, basic techniques for data preprocessing such as normalization, regression, and classic matrix decomposition methods such as SVD, LU, and QR decompositions. In the second part of the course, students will develop a basic understanding of classification and clustering and be able to apply classic methods such as k-means, hierarchical clustering methods, nearest neighbor methods, association based classifiers. In the third part of the course, students will have a chance to study more advanced data mining applications such as feature selection in high-dimensional data, dimension reduction, and mining biological datasets. Upon successfully completing this course, you will: 1. Learn basic concepts, algorithms, and techniques in data mining, 2. Perform real data analysis using popular tools and languages (e.g., Python and libraries) 3. Prepare for innovative research in data mining. You will also learn HTML, CSS and React"
